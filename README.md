Project Name: obstacle avoidance vehicle
Purpose of the Project: Using sensors to auto avoid the obstacles.
Functionality: 
1. Three sensors on the vehicle can measure the distance between the vehicle and the 
obstacles. 
2. When the car need go straight, the motors can have the same speed, when the car need to 
turn, motors can change the directions. 
3. Sensors can communicate with motors through STM32 board, when the distance between 
the obstacles and vehicle is short, the vehicle can turn to the free road.
